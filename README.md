starbound-sbbf02
================

This is the beginnings of a library to parse Starbound's SBBF02 format.
The SBBF02 format is what makes up the `.world` files, for example.

Feel free to contribute with information either via code or issues.

Trying it
---------

It's very barebones right now, but if you put the two `.py` files in the
Starbound directory and run `test.py`, you'll see information output for
some SBBF02 files in your Starbound directory.
